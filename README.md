# ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer: SoftHSM

This project, **SoftHSM**, is an educational and experimental implementation of a software-based Hardware Security Module (HSM) designed to store and manage cryptographic keys securely.

**SoftHSM is NOT intended for production use in critical systems or environments requiring high-level security guarantees.** While we aim to follow best practices for cryptographic storage, this software does not provide the same level of security as dedicated hardware HSM devices.

### üõ°Ô∏è Use at Your Own Risk
- **No warranty** is provided for data integrity, security, or protection against vulnerabilities.
- Ensure you understand the risks before using **SoftHSM** in any sensitive application.

### üìå Key Points:
- Designed for **educational** and **development** purposes.
- **Do not** use for securing real-world financial assets or sensitive information.
- Regularly review and audit the code for your specific security requirements.

By using **SoftHSM**, you agree that the authors and contributors are **not liable** for any data loss, security breaches, or other damages.
